  *   README Requirements 
  * =======================
  *   (From PS8 assignment brief)
  * Your project README should document all of your design decisions, 
  *   as well as detailing any features you wish the graders to be aware of.
  *
  * This file will be the "first stop" when your work is being evaluated. 
  * Set the tone by doing a good job describing what works and doesn't work, 
  *   as well as listing interesting things (i.e., features) 
  *   that you would like the graders to be aware of.
