/**
 * << Scratch Code File >>
 ** This is a file for testing out code on the fly
 ** It relies of the CodeRunner vs code extension 
 **   and the scriptcs utility (https://scriptcs.net)
 **   in order to run without having to build everything.
 ** Therefore, nothing in this file can be contained 
 **   in a namespace, if you want to run & debug it, 
 **   without having to deal w/ MSBuild as vs sol system.
